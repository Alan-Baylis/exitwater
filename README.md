# ExitWater

A shader based exit water effect i did to enchance [Ceto: Ocean System](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/47203), an Unity plugin.

Uses a global shader from Ceto to know above and below water. Won't work well without it.

Texture tweaked from some example off the internet.

## How to get it working:

* Include directory on Assets folder of unity project
* Add new exitwater script component to main camera
* Add water texture to all 3 texture slots (expects 1 channel texture)
* Add exitwater.shader to shader slot
* Tweak values as prefered

Tested on Unity 5.3.3f1
